The analysis project below is derived from survey data on 418 participants in different regions of the U.K.. They were asked about the weekday and weekend smoking habits, along with a variety of demographic factors. Two main analyses were conducted, cross validation and a LASSO model. Cross validation helps to depict the best type of model to use, especially by using the LOOCV. The first graph below will show a general overview of the amount of cigarettes smoked on the weekdays by region. Secondly, the next graph will show the graph for the best lambda predictor before the parsimonious model.
